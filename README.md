# Gold Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict gold prices using various machine learning techniques. The system analyzes historical data, extracts patterns, and forecasts future prices.

## Introduction
Gold price prediction is a critical task for investors and businesses dealing in precious metals. This project uses historical gold prices and applies machine learning algorithms to forecast future trends.

## Features
- Preprocessing and visualization of historical gold price data.
- Implementation of machine learning models for prediction.
- Performance evaluation and comparison of models.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for development
- Libraries:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `numpy` for numerical computations
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive development.

## Data
- **Dataset**: Historical gold prices obtained from [source name or link].
- The dataset includes fields like:
  - Date
  - Gold price
